# Philips Hue Zigbee

This app allows you to connect your Philips Hue Zigbee Devices to Homey

# Supported Devices
* Philip Hue Dimmer Switch

## Note:
It seems to be kind of troubling to include a bulb to homey directly, which makes it very hard to remove and readd to the bridge if the user ever wanted to.  
Not sure if I want that responsibility yet at least until zigbee on homey is more stable
